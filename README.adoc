== Lolcat

== Installation

  git clone repository
  cd lolcat
  make
  sudo make install

== Key differences to cat

* Providing - as a commandline argument is not supported. The V cli module interprets - as a start of a commandline flag and will try to match it to a registered flag which will fail
* When reading from stdin, lolcat will wait for all input before printing to stdout instead of echoing each line after pressing enter
