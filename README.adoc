== Lolcat

An imperfect implementation of the https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat[lolcat] program in the https://vlang.io/[V Programming Language]

== Installation

  git clone https://github.com/chrisBirmingham/v-lolcat
  cd v-lolcat
  make
  sudo make install

== Key differences to cat

* Providing - as a commandline argument is not supported. The V cli module interprets - as a start of a commandline flag and will try to match it to a registered flag which will fail
* When reading from stdin, lolcat will wait for all input before printing to stdout instead of echoing each line after pressing enter

== Inspiration

* Jim Bumgardner for his excellent tutorial on making annoying rainbows https://krazydad.com/tutorials/makecolors.php[here]
* And of cource https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat[lolcat]
